    <h2> AUTO-BIOGRAPHY </h2>
    <P>I was born in Nsukka, Enugu State, into the family of
     Mr. George Ikechukwu and Mrs. Thecla Ifeoma. As the first
    child and the first son, my early life was marked by challenges,
    and growing up wasn't always easy.Though the experience was difficult,
    my mother, played a pivotal role in making my childhood more bearable,
    providing love and support during trying times. While I do not carry 
    many fond memories from my younger years, those hardships shaped me 
    into the resilient person I am today.</P>
    <p>My educational journey began at Sancta Maria Nursery and Primary School
    in Nsukka, where I laid the foundation for my academic growth.I went on to 
    complete my secondary education at Saint Teresa's College in Nsukka, Enugu State.
    My curiosity, particularly in science, were evident even then even tho I also had
    a skill for art and crafts. Originally, I was drawn to the idea of Chemical 
    Engineering due to my fascination with drugs and their properties. However, 
    a family friend helped me discover the right field of study, Pharmacy, because
     before then I was hellbent on studying Chemical Engineering because I thought 
     that that was the science of drugs.</p>
     <p>Today, I am a 600-level Pharmacy student at the University of Nigeria Nsukka, 
    studying at the Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. Everyday I wish to learn so much
    more about drugs, even tho i am a truant in school Which fortunately never shows in my grades.
    Asides drugs, I really enjoy cooking and reading fantasy books </p>
    <p> I have always tried to gain skills; I learnt tailoring and bakery during my time in secondary school.
    I would always love to gain skills that I would enjoy doing and that will add value to me.
    in my search for such skills a friend recommended that I learn a tech skill and that
    I do so at ALTSCHOOL. I am at Altschool to learn skills that would add value to me, 
    give me the knowledge, guidiance and disciplne to become a better and more productive member of society.
