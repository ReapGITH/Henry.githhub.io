    <h2> ABOUT ME</h2>
    <section>
    <P> The first and most obvious thing people get to notice about me
        if they meet me is my deep and severe love for music.</P>
    <p> My love and maybe dependence on music has been with me since I can remember, starting from growing up listening<br>
        to Celine Dion every day to growing up and becoming a music addict and lover of any and every good music in every genre of music there is.</p>
    <p> Music has always been there for me and that has helped me grow and go through life as horribly as it came.</p> 
    </P>
    <p>Two of my most played songs of the last year I have put below. These two songs show some of the most emotions that I felt the previous year .</p>

    <section>
        <p>Another thing about me, I love movies. I watch and watch any good movie<br>
        regardless of the language it was done in. On that note, it should be obvious<br>
        that I watch Kdrama, Bollywood movies, thai Movies, japanese movies, Hollywood movies,<br>
        Nollywood (my least consumed movies), anime (my best anime of all time being BLEACH), etc.</p>
        
       <p>A clip from a movie I have enjoyed in the past:</p> 
       <p>
        <video 
        src="./ASSET 1/GhoomarPadmaavat.mp4"
        controls
        width="360"
        height="350"></video>
        <br>The clip above is from the Movie Padmaavat which is set In medieval India. A tyrannical sultan and his army attack a<br> 
        prosperous kingdom to try and capture the beautiful Queen Padmavati. Her husband Maharawal Ratan Singh<br>
        assembles his valiant forces to defend his land and the honor of his beloved wife.<br>
